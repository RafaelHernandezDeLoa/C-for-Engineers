# C-for-Engineers
Contains some of my early C++ code

Project 4: Used a combination of variables, while loops and if statements to manage how many calculations I have to make parallel of series calculations on resistor values given

Project 9: Learned what a finite machine is and what it looks like, learned how to code a program based on a finite state machine

project 11: Utilized rand() and srand() to generate random numbers to generate simple practice multiplication and division problems

project 12: Demonstrates the knowledge that I have gained throughtout this course
